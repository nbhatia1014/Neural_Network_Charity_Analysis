# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview:
### Purpose:
The purpose of this module is to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. We will be using our knowledge of machine learning and nueral networks to analze the given dataset.

## Questions:

### Data Preprocessing
- The data provided shows a column for 'IS_SUCCESSFUL,' and will be the targeted data point for these predictions.
- There are many data points (features) that will be used as input for the models. Included are:
    - AFFILIATION
    - APPLICATION_TYPE
    - ASK_AMT
    - CLASSIFICATION
    - INCOME_AMT
    - ORGANIZATION
    - SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS
    - STATUS
    - USE_CASE
- The columns for "NAME" and "EIN" have no direct effect on the success/falure rate, and have been excluded from processing.
### Compiling, Training, and evaluating the model
